# Web Prototype Implementation Plan

Date: 2026-04-13

## Goal

Build a Docker-runnable web prototype for Viva Medical's internal business management system.

The prototype is not a marketing website. It is a desktop-first internal operations tool for service, sales, and admin users who manage medical equipment service work, document creation pipelines, document processing status, work acts, approvals, and job completion.

## Product Scope

The first prototype should support these workflows:

- Service job intake for medical equipment.
- Job status monitoring from request to finished work act.
- Document creation pipeline for service documents, sales documents, and administrative documents.
- Service technician workflow with diagnostics, repair, parts, vendor return, and final checklist.
- Sales workflow for quotations, customer approval, contract/warranty context, and handoff to service.
- Admin workflow for user role visibility, overdue work, document exceptions, and system configuration.

The prototype should use realistic demo data, not a real backend yet.

## Technology Direction

The original `design_system.md` recommends a single `.html` file. For this new request, the prototype should still visually follow that design system, but the code should be modularized.

Recommended implementation:

- `src/index.html` - app shell and mount points.
- `src/styles/` - CSS split by purpose.
- `src/js/` - modular JavaScript files.
- `src/data/` - demo data and workflow definitions.
- `public/` - generated or copied static output served by Docker.
- `Dockerfile` - static nginx container.
- `docker-compose.yml` - local web service.

No heavy frontend framework is needed for the first prototype. Use vanilla JavaScript modules so the app stays easy to inspect and close to the existing design system.

All code comments must be in English.

## Document Generation Direction

The Documents module should be designed for a later Carbone integration.

Reference:

- Carbone GitHub: `https://github.com/carboneio/carbone`

Planned use:

- Users prepare LibreOffice or Microsoft Office templates such as `.odt`, `.docx`, `.ods`, or `.xlsx`.
- The system injects job, customer, equipment, parts, and approval data into templates using JSON data.
- Users generate work acts, diagnostic reports, quotations, acceptance reports, contract annexes, warranty confirmations, parts requests, and vendor return notes.
- Users can save generated documents as `.docx`, `.odt`, or `.pdf`.
- Users can download the generated file and send it through the mail client they already use on their own PC.

Carbone integration notes from the upstream project:

- Carbone is a server-side report generator that injects JSON data into document templates.
- It supports templates from LibreOffice and Microsoft Office formats such as ODT, DOCX, ODS, XLSX, PPTX, and related XML-based formats.
- PDF conversion needs a server-side document converter. LibreOffice is the established path documented by Carbone.
- The static prototype should only model the UI and pipeline states. Actual Carbone rendering belongs in a later backend/document-service phase.

Future backend shape:

- `document-service` container with Node.js, Carbone, LibreOffice, and a templates volume.
- `templates/` volume for approved document templates.
- `generated/` volume for output files.
- API endpoints for preview, generate DOCX/ODT, generate PDF, and download.
- Audit trail fields for who generated, reviewed, approved, downloaded, or sent a document.

Document module UI step:

- Add a "Templates" tab in the Documents module.
- Add template cards for service act, diagnostic report, quotation, acceptance report, and vendor return.
- Add a "Generate from template" action on documents and service jobs.
- In the first UI prototype, this action should open a mock generation panel that shows selected template, source JSON payload, output format, and a planned backend integration state.

## Proposed File Structure

```text
.
|-- Dockerfile
|-- docker-compose.yml
|-- vm-web-control.cmd
|-- vm-web-control.ps1
|-- public/
|   `-- index.html
|-- src/
|   |-- index.html
|   |-- js/
|   |   |-- app.js
|   |   |-- data.js
|   |   |-- dom.js
|   |   |-- navigation.js
|   |   |-- render.js
|   |   |-- state.js
|   |   `-- wizard.js
|   `-- styles/
|       |-- base.css
|       |-- shell.css
|       |-- components.css
|       |-- pages.css
|       `-- wizard.css
`-- docs/
    `-- WEB_PROTOTYPE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
```

For phase one, `public/index.html` can be the runnable assembled artifact. If we want to avoid a build pipeline at first, it can load CSS and JS directly from copied static paths.

## Docker Plan

Use nginx to serve the static prototype.

Planned service:

- Service name: `web`
- Port: `8080:80`
- Image built from local `Dockerfile`
- Static root: `/usr/share/nginx/html`

Suggested commands:

```powershell
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose ps
```

Root control utility:

- `vm-web-control.cmd` opens the Windows-friendly launcher.
- `vm-web-control.ps1` supports `menu`, `on`, `off`, `restart`, `status`, `logs`, `open`, and `quit`.
- Web startup and restart controls must stay outside the web UI, because a broken or stopped web app cannot reliably start itself.

Because the current environment approval policy is `never`, if Docker commands require outside-sandbox access, the assistant should not request escalation. Instead, provide the exact command for the user to run manually.

## App Shell

Follow `design_system.md`:

- Topbar with Viva Medical / Service IS wordmark.
- Sidebar with grouped navigation.
- Main area with one active page at a time.
- Page header with title, subtitle, and contextual actions.
- Content area using stat cards, tiles, tables, flow diagrams, and wizard modal.
- No web-hosted `CMD` start/stop/restart control. Use the root control utility instead.

Primary navigation:

- Command Center
- Service
- Sales
- Documents
- Template Generation
- Finance
- Customers
- Equipment
- Parts
- Reports
- Admin

Role switcher:

- Service user
- Sales user
- Admin user

The role switcher is only a prototype control. It should change visible emphasis, dashboard cards, and allowed action labels, but it does not need authentication yet.

## Core Data Model For Demo State

Use plain JavaScript objects in `src/js/data.js`.

## Component Inventory

Build reusable render helpers:

- `renderPageHeader()`
- `renderStatCard()`
- `renderModuleTile()`
- `renderSubgroupTile()`
- `renderDataTable()`
- `renderStatusChip()`
- `renderPipelineBoard()`
- `renderFlowNode()`
- `renderFlowTrack()`
- `renderWizardStepIndicator()`
- `renderDurationField()`
- `renderChecklist()`
- `renderInfoBox()`
- `renderDecisionCards()`

Keep these helpers pure where possible: input data in, HTML string out.

## Interaction Plan

Prototype interactions:

- Sidebar changes active page.
- Role switcher changes dashboard framing and visible mock permissions.
- Table row click opens a side/detail panel or updates a detail area.
- "New service job" opens wizard modal.
- Decision cards change wizard state inline.
- Diagnostics and repair time are entered manually as duration fields after the user completes each procedure.
- Submitting wizard adds a new demo job into in-memory state and returns to Service page.
- Document action buttons move demo documents between pipeline statuses.

No real persistence is required in phase one. Optional phase two can add `localStorage`.

## Styling Plan

Use `design_system.md` as the visual contract:

- Dark topbar/sidebar.
- Brand accent border on topbar and modal.
- CSS variables for all colors.
- Card radius no larger than 8px.
- Stable table, tile, and toolbar dimensions.
- No animations or keyframes.
- Hover uses border or shadow changes only.

Palette direction:

- Avoid a one-note blue/slate UI.
- Use a clean medical palette with dark neutral shell, green/teal brand signal, red/amber/green operational status colors, and white/very light cool surfaces.
- Keep all colors in `:root`.

## Full Role List

| Role | ID | Responsibilities |
|---|---|---|
| Service Engineer | service | Creates technical cases, logs diagnostics/repair duration, uploads signed documents |
| Service Manager | svcmgr | Approves parts requests, assigns engineers, controls service queue |
| Sales / Sales Manager | sales | Commercial offers, contract upload/indexing, customer approval, invoice handoff |
| Finance | finance | Generates/uploads invoices, manages payment status (paid/pending/canceled) |
| Office Manager | office | Customer registry, contacts, calendar, case creation, reminders to engineers |
| Logistics Manager | logistics | Parts delivery, vendor returns, logistics issue resolution |
| Warehouse | warehouse | Stock confirmation, parts arrival, inventory management |
| Manager | manager | Read-only overview across all modules and reports |
| Admin | admin | Full control, user permission grid, case close, contract archive management |

Admin assigns permissions via a per-user checkbox grid. One user can hold multiple roles.

---

## Pipeline Types

### Type A — Repair Without Service Contract

```
Technical Case → Diagnostics (duration entry) → Parts check
  → [if parts needed] Parts Request → Service Manager approves → Logistics/Warehouse fulfills → Engineer notified
  → Commercial Offer (customer must confirm: cost and what will be changed)
  → Repair (duration entry)
  → Work Act generation → Signature collected → Upload signed document into system
  → INVOICE NEEDED status → Finance generates/uploads invoice PDF
  → Engineer downloads → collects signature → uploads signed invoice
  → Admin review: [Diagnostics ✓][Commercial offer ✓][Repair ✓][System working ✓]
  → Approval Required → Admin Approves → ARCHIVED
```

### Type B — Repair With Service Contract

```
Technical Case → Diagnostics → Parts check (if needed)
  → Repair (system shows contract balance; warns if repair cost > remaining balance)
  → Work Act → Signature → Upload
  → Admin review → ARCHIVED
```

Contract balance logic: contract has a total amount (e.g. €100,000) and duration (e.g. 36 months). Each repair deducts the consumed amount. Visible in repair workflow and contract view: remaining balance / consumed / work history.

### Type C — New System Installation

```
Sales: Commercial Offer → Customer approval
  → Contract indexing (fields + warranty dates + comments section for any missing field info)
  → Installation (engineer)
  → Acceptance Act generation → Signature → Upload
  → WARRANTY STARTS from upload date (not from admin approval date)
  → Admin verification (manual check only) → ARCHIVED
  → Calendar syncs warranty expiry date
```

### Type D — PM Periodic Maintenance

```
System AUTO generates PM case from contract
  → PM submodule status: [Scheduled / Unscheduled / Problem]
  → Date distribution: even split over contract period
    (rule: N visits / M months, evenly spaced — e.g. 4x/year = one per quarter; stacking consecutive months not allowed)
  → User can move date within same month → main calendar auto-updates
  → Service work → Work Act → Admin review → ARCHIVED
```

---

## Document Types

Work Act / Diagnostic Report / Commercial Offer / Contract Annex / Warranty Confirmation / Parts Request / Vendor Return Note / Acceptance Report / Invoice

Document pipeline: `Draft → Review → Customer → Signature → Approved → Archived`

Rejection path: `Rejected → Draft` (comment required). Permanent rejection: comment + Admin resolves.

Create (from Carbone template, mock in prototype) or Upload (external document with indexed metadata).

Upload metadata fields (indexed for global search): location · contract reference · date · executor · who signed · short description.

Search: filter chips (type / owner / status / customer / date range) + free text field + Search / Cancel buttons.

---

## Support Portal — Client Fault Reporting

Each installed system record has a **Support** tab with three sub-tabs:

### Settings sub-tab
- **Support Page Is Enabled** checkbox — when checked, the system generates unique URLs for this installed system
- **Group Name** — groups multiple systems under one support URL (e.g. all systems at one hospital department)
- **Image (override)** — optional custom image for the support page

### Emails sub-tab
- **Company Emails** — Viva Medical internal recipients for new case notifications
- **Manufacturer Emails** — manufacturer rep notification on new fault
- **Hospital Emails** — hospital-side contact who gets confirmation when case is created

### Web Links sub-tab
- **System link** — unique URL for this specific installed system (with Copy button)
- **Hospital link** — URL scoped to all systems at the hospital
- **Group link** — URL scoped to all systems in the group

### Support page flow
When a hospital staff member visits the system link:
1. Page shows: system name, model, location (pre-filled from system record, no login required)
2. Staff fills in: short problem description + optional contact name
3. Submit → new Technical Case is auto-created in the system
4. Case is pre-filled with: system info / hospital / problem description / source = "Support portal"
5. Case status: **New / Unassigned**
6. Admin receives notification → assigns case to engineer → normal service pipeline continues

In the prototype: the Support tab UI is shown on the Equipment detail page. The public support page is a planned sub-page (no authentication). Mock case creation on submit.

---

## Parts Flow

```
Engineer identifies part needed (during diagnostics)
→ Parts request created with situation description
→ Service Manager approves
→ Logistics / Warehouse fulfills
→ Parts arrive → Warehouse confirms → Engineer notified
→ Engineer specifies delivery:
   [Pick up from warehouse]  OR  [Deliver to site: address + contact person (saveable to registry)]
   Recipient: named engineer OR local person at site
→ Repair proceeds
```

Vendor return: triggered by "repair exchange" in Work Act. Logistics creates return case. Engineer specifies destination: bad-parts spot or warehouse re-stock.

Delivery address registry: hospital address + contact person saved from customer registry. Autofill suggestions when entering address on future parts requests.

---

## Calendar

- Colour-coded by user
- Filters: user / date range / equipment / service contract
- Permission-based: user sees own events; with permission sees assigned users; Admin sees all and can assign
- Event types: Service case / Diagnostics / Repair / PM visit / Sales meeting / Equipment demo / Contract validity period
- PM date distribution: even split over contract period; user can move date within same month; main calendar auto-updates
- Contract validity visible when filtering by contract

---

## Reminders

Sidebar strip (list type). Each entry: `place / case open date / status` with colour indicator (red/yellow/green/gray). Office Manager and users with permissions can send reminders to engineers (collect signature, upload document).

---

### Open — Next steps

| ID | Task | Description |
|---|---|---|
| B-24 | **fodt template upload/export** | Add "Upload .fodt template" or "Export sections as .fodt" button in Output Templates tab. Requires `POST /template/upload` endpoint in `document-service`. Connects UI section editor content to actual `.fodt` files used by Carbone. |
| B-25 | **Tomis comparison pass** | Re-examine Tomis read-only after B-17–B-21. Compare terminology, flow order, missing fields, density. Document differences in `docs/DOCUMENT_GENERATION_TOMIS_FINDINGS.md`. |

---

## Tomis Document Generation Findings

Detailed read-only findings are documented in `docs/DOCUMENT_GENERATION_TOMIS_FINDINGS.md`.

Core decision:
- Work List Template = equipment/procedure checklist copied into a concrete Work Act.
- Document Output Template = standardized printable form rendered by Carbone/LibreOffice.
- Work Act generation flow implemented: Draft record -> auto-prefill equipment from case/equipment or manual equipment search/add/remove -> apply Work List Template -> edit isolated work rows/work description -> generate output document draft.
- The current generic template editor is temporary and should be superseded by the Work Act-specific workflow.

## Documentation Rule

After every implementation session:
1. Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — add entries under `[Unreleased]`.
2. Update `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` section 18 — mark completed backlog items ✅, add new items as they arise.
3. `git commit` + `git push` — one commit per session's work.
